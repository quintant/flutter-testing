# myapp

A flutter program that enables you to do simple actions on discord as a bot

## Getting Started

You need to create a bot on discord and copy the token from there and paste it into the field.

Then you can log in as a bot

### Current features:

- Log in
- View all servers/guilds the bot has access to
- View all members in selected server
- View all channels in selected server

This is all made using flutter and the discord api.

I am making this more as a practice in using APIs and Flutter.
